# Privacy Policy for KakuMaster

**Effective Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026  

KakuMaster is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### Local Data Storage (No Personal Data Collection)
KakuMaster is designed as an "offline-first" application. Your study progress, including mastered Kanji, quiz scores, and settings, is stored exclusively on your device using browser storage (LocalStorage/IndexedDB).

- **We do not collect or store any Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** such as your name, email address, or phone number.
- We do not host a central database. Your study data never leaves your device unless you explicitly use the "Export" feature to save a backup file to your own local storage.

## 2. Data Safety & Security
- **Data Encryption**: All data handled by the app is processed within the secure sandbox of the mobile browser/PWA environment.
- **Data Sharing**: We do not share any user data with third parties.
- **Third-Party Tracking**: We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs (like Firebase Analytics or Facebook SDK).
- **No Ads**: The app does not contain advertisements.

## 3. Permissions
The app may request the following permissions only when necessary:
- **Storage/Files**: Required only if you choose to "Export" or "Import" your study backup file.
- **Notifications**: Used only if you enable reminders (for example, study reminders). Notification scheduling and delivery are handled by your device/operating system. We do not collect personal data from notifications and we do not use notifications for advertising or tracking.
- **Vibration/Haptics**: Used for tactile feedback during writing practice.

## 4. Data Deletion
Users have full control over their data. You can permanently delete all study progress and settings at any time by navigating to **Settings > Data Management > Reset All Data**.

## 5. Children's Privacy
KakuMaster is a general audience educational tool. Since we do not collect any personal information or transmit data to a central server, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## 6. Financial and Health Features
KakuMaster does not provide financial services, medical advice, or health-tracking features.
